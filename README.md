Fractal App (2D)
===========================================
Fractal App is a simple app to view and play with 2D fractal, as of now only the mandelbrot set. It allow user to specify parameters to generate high-quality image. It is plan in the future to make it able to generate animation.

# Docs
Documentation is build with MKdocs. All the `.mk` file are in the `docs/` folder. You can view them nicely by placing yourself in the project folder and entering the command `mkdocs serve`. Then enter in your browser the custom adress showed (something like `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). If you prefer, you can build the site instead of creating a server with the command `mkdocs build`. In the `site/` it will create, open `index.html`.  

# Work in progress
- [ ] OOP Image calculation
- [ ] mandelbrot math
- [ ] pygame image viewer OOP
- [ ] small animation / zoom incorporation in main.py

# Features to come (maybe)
- optimisation
- logging (instead of debuggin with print)
- executables
- test units (proper one with a library)
- documentation (with mkdocs)
